# Application Structure

- `index.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the routes and models we'll be using in the application.
- `routers/controllers` - This folder contains configuration for passport as well as a central location for configuration/environment variables. It has 4 files 1- role.js 2- user.js 3- post.js 4- comment.js
- `routers/middlewares` - This folder contains the middlewares  for our API. It has 3 files 1- authentication.js 2- authorization.js 3- exist.js
- `routers/routes` - This folder contains the route definitions for our API. It has 4 files 1- role.js 2- user.js 3- post.js 4- comment.js
- `db/index.js` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models.
- `db/models` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models. It has 5 files 1- role.js 2- user.js 3- post.js 4- comment.js 5- like.js

# API Documentation
Create a new key authToken and within the /signin request this value is automatically updated after a successfull login through a script located in the tests tab. Each time you make a request to the API it will send Authorization header with the token value in the request, you can check this on the headers of user endpoints in the Postman example.

This is a REST API, so it works using the following HTTP methods:

*   GET (Read): Gets a list of items, or a single item
*   POST (Create): Creates an item
*   PATCH (Update): Updates an item
*   DELETE: Deletes an item

# Error Handling

### Authentication

To require authentication for certain routes, you can use the `authentication` middleware.
An access token can be generated by making a successful call to the signin (POST /signin) endpoints. An access token is valid for 60 minutes.

### Authorization
The `authorization` middleware can also be used to require certain rights/permissions to access a route.

### Exist
The `exist` middleware can also be used to require check user is not deleted.

If the user making the request does not have the required permissions to access a route, a Forbidden (403) error is thrown.
